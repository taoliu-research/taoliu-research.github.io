## Temporal Regulatory Inconsistency (TRI)

Temporal Regulatory Inconsistency (TRI) is a conceptual, time-dynamic framework proposed to account for stable yet structured within-individual variability in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Rather than focusing on average-level deficits, the TRI framework emphasizes fluctuations in regulatory alignment across time, integrating behavioral, physiological, and neural observations into a unified temporal perspective.

## Current Status

The TRI framework is under active, staged development.

- **Version 1 (v1)**  
  Conceptual and descriptive formulation  
  Archived on Zenodo  
  DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17953456

- **Version 2 (v2)** *(in preparation)*
