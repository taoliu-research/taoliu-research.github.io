## Temporal Regulatory Inconsistency (TRI)

**Temporal Regulatory Inconsistency (TRI)** is a conceptual, time-dynamic framework proposed to account for stable yet structured within-individual variability in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Rather than focusing on average-level deficits, the TRI framework emphasizes fluctuations in regulatory alignment across time, integrating behavioral, physiological, and neural observations into a unified temporal perspective.

## Current Status

This website documents the ongoing development of the TRI framework.

- **Version 1 (v1)**: Conceptual formulation (available on Zenodo)
- Subsequent versions will introduce operational definitions, empirical demonstrations, and model-based formalizations.
