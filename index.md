## Temporal Regulatory Inconsistency (TRI)

Temporal Regulatory Inconsistency (TRI) is a conceptual, time-dynamic framework proposed to account for stable yet structured within-individual variability in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Rather than focusing on average-level deficits, the TRI framework emphasizes fluctuations in regulatory alignment across time, integrating behavioral, physiological, and neural observations into a unified temporal perspective.
