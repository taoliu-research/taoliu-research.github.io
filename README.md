This repository hosts the official GitHub Pages website for the **ExplorerBrain Research Initiative**, with a primary focus on the **Temporal Regulatory Inconsistency (TRI)** framework.

The website serves as an **explanatory and navigational layer** for the TRI framework, providing a structured overview of its conceptual scope, positioning, and versioning.

## Temporal Regulatory Inconsistency (TRI)

**Temporal Regulatory Inconsistency (TRI)** is a time-dynamic framework proposed to account for stable yet structured within-individual variability in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

The current public presentation corresponds to **Version 1 (v1)** of the framework, which is explicitly conceptual and descriptive in nature.

## Scholarly record and citation

The **authoritative, citable scholarly version** of TRI v1 is archived on Zenodo:

## Website vs. scholarly record

- **Zenodo (v1)**  
  Frozen, versioned, and citable scholarly record.

- **Website (this repository)**  
  Explanatory and navigational presentation aligned with Zenodo v1, intended to support understanding and future development.

The website does not introduce new empirical claims or finalized mechanistic models beyond those described in the Zenodo v1 record.
